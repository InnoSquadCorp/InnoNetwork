# Roadmap

## 6.0.0 Release Boundary

`6.0.0` is still an unreleased draft. Its scope is the compatibility reset
already described in `docs/releases/6.0.0.md`: the operation-first contract
moves into `InnoNetwork`, HLS moves to InnoStream, and recovery decisions gain
explicit HTTP, authentication, and replay-safety context. No item in the 6.1
candidate list below is a blocker for that release.

The root `@APIDefinition(method:path:auth:)` macro, default-enabled `Macros`
trait, and `traits: []` opt-out are Stable in this 6.0 boundary. Their 5.x
adoption and permanent macro, diagnostic, and consumer gates satisfy the
promotion criteria; they are not deferred to 6.1.

The 6.0 exit gate is evidence, not another feature pass: the API allowlists,
package preflight, non-HLS consumers, InnoStream local integration, companion
packages, and finally clean remote-tag consumers must all agree with the
published contract.

## 6.1.0 Candidate Scope

The first minor after 6.0 should be additive and operationally narrow. A
candidate enters implementation only with an API sketch, a named adopter or
reproducible protocol gap, negative-path tests, and a measurement or fixture
that can become a permanent gate. Items are ordered by expected consumer
value, not by implementation convenience.

### Priority 0 — correctness and adoption evidence

1. **Conditional cache revalidation — completed for the 6.0 boundary.** A
   valid `Last-Modified` now emits `If-Modified-Since`, dual validators are
   preserved, malformed dates fail closed, and `304` substitution follows the
   same bounded path after persistent-cache reopen. Unsafe methods and Vary
   mismatches continue to bypass conditional reuse.
2. **End-to-end operation deadline — implemented for the 6.1 candidate.**
   `NetworkOperationDeadline` applies one monotonic budget across request
   preparation, authentication, cache lookup, policy admission, reachability,
   retry delay, transport, and decoding. Expiry cancels built-in client work
   and reports a payload-free `NetworkOperationDeadlineStage`; recovery still
   obeys method and explicit replay safety. Deterministic tests cover expired
   input, retry delay, caller cancellation, successful timer cleanup, and
   coalesced callers with different budgets. The operation-first API returns a
   buffered value, so separately returned streaming sequences are explicitly
   outside this deadline contract rather than receiving a partial promise.
3. **Promote only proven remaining provisional surfaces.** Use each surface's
   relevant app and companion-package consumers to identify declarations used
   without wrappers or SPI. `@APIDefinition` is the deliberate 6.0 promotion;
   other surfaces remain evidence-gated. Promotion is a compatibility promise,
   not a declaration-count target.

### Priority 1 — explicit opt-in capabilities

1. **Directive-aware cache controls — implemented for the 6.1 candidate.**
   `staleIfError(wrapping:)` requires both an explicit caller wrapper and a
   valid response `stale-if-error=N` directive, preserves caller/server
   freshness ceilings, and returns stale data only after the retry policy
   declines another attempt. `requestOnlyIfCached(wrapping:)` consumes the
   request directive only when opted in, returns an immediately reusable
   entry without transport, and fails locally when revalidation would be
   required. Cancellation, trust, configuration, decoding, and body-limit
   failures never use stale data; authenticated entries still follow the
   existing admission and identity rules. `immutable`, synthesized `Age`, and
   default-policy consumption remain separate decisions.
2. **Managed-upload controls — implemented for the 6.1 candidate.** Pause and
   resume are idempotent, background restoration persists user-paused intent,
   and retry requires the original stable `Idempotency-Key` plus an explicitly
   refreshed request and readable source file. A retry reuses only the logical
   task identity and receives a new pre-registered event stream; it cannot
   change destination or method and cannot restart cancelled or completed
   uploads. This surface remains Provisionally Stable pending external adopter
   evidence.
3. **Caller-owned streaming cursors — implemented locally.** The additive
   `StreamingResumePolicy.cursor` supports NDJSON and other line-oriented
   protocols with a validated reconnect header, a 4 KiB cursor cap, and
   transient-only bounded resume. Lossy buffering and automatic redirects are
   rejected. Response-scoped decoder factories and an opt-in aggregate SSE
   event limit cover interrupted/concurrent streams and multiline memory growth.
   Real TCP disconnect fixtures validate custom cursors and explicit resets;
   server replay/deduplication still belongs to the application.
4. **Exporter-neutral request span lifecycle — implemented for the 6.1
   candidate.** `NetworkSpanObserver` relates logical requests and physical
   dispatch attempts without importing a vendor SDK or exposing request and
   response bodies. Cache hits, coalesced followers, and failures before
   dispatch retain a logical span but do not invent a transport attempt.
   Retry attempts remain child spans and export through a bounded queue.

### Priority 2 — operational scheduling

- **Advanced rate limiting — implemented for the 6.1 candidate.** The opt-in
  policy provides monotonic token-bucket and exact sliding-window scheduling,
  bounded origin state, cancellation-aware waiting, and conservative
  `Retry-After` or versioned draft-11 feedback. Numeric configurations fail
  before sleeping, dormant fully replenished origins release registry slots,
  and quota is rechecked after concurrency admission at the actual dispatch
  boundary. Keep this surface Provisionally Stable until a real adopter's
  server quota model and production traffic evidence validate the choice.

### Admission and release gates

- Each feature ships independently; an unfinished Priority 1 item does not
  hold the minor release.
- Public additions update symbol allowlists, API stability classification,
  changelog, migration examples, and DocC in the same commit.
- HTTP behavior needs deterministic URLProtocol fixtures plus persistent-cache
  parity where applicable; streaming behavior needs disconnect, duplicate,
  gap, cancellation, and memory-bound tests.
- Performance-sensitive paths must stay within the existing release benchmark
  budgets, and diagnostics must prove header/body redaction.
- At least one real consumer must build without SPI for any surface proposed
  for Stable promotion.

### Explicitly outside 6.1

- HLS parsing, playback, download, FairPlay, and live DVR remain owned by
  InnoStream.
- gRPC, HTTP/3 ownership, WebTransport, a SwiftNIO transport, and WebSocket
  `permessage-deflate` are separate products or major design efforts.
- Renaming configuration packs, reshaping `NetworkError`, or removing
  provisional declarations requires a later major release.
- Automatic replay of unsafe requests, automatic reuse of opaque body streams,
  and a claim of complete RFC 9111 compliance are not minor-release goals.

## Historical release context

Everything below this heading is retained as design history for the 4.x and
5.x lines. It is not the active 6.1 backlog.

## 5.0.0 Release Scope

The 5.0.0 release converted the hardening backlog into an explicit
major-version contract:

- request execution policies preserve the executor-owned request identity;
- body-aware signing runs after interceptors and refresh-token application and
  signs the exact data or file snapshot sent by the transport;
- signed requests bypass caches/coalescing and reject automatic redirects;
- default redirects deny HTTPS downgrade and unsafe cross-origin replay;
- download and WebSocket shutdown paths have bounded, exactly-once cleanup;
- refresh generations, cache lookup sharing, and circuit-breaker half-open
  hysteresis have deterministic tests;
- release provenance, recursive CycloneDX SBOMs, coverage, release-mode
  benchmarks, and all-product DocC are enforced by CI; and
- explicit endpoint structs become the macro-first catalog shape: the root
  `@APIDefinition` macro derives boilerplate, requires visible response/auth
  intent, and fails closed on unsafe or ambiguous definitions; and
- small integrations can start with `DefaultNetworkClient(baseURL:)`, while
  typed one-off requests use the existing `EndpointBuilder<Response>` surface
  without opting into unrelated policy models; and
- the seven deprecated configuration modifiers and package-internal reducer
  vocabulary are removed from the public API.

The released source migration is documented in `docs/Migration-5.0.0.md`. Remaining
items below are either historical context or post-5.0 candidates.

## 4.0.0 Implementation Scope

The 4.0.0 improvement PR folds the former minor and major-candidate backlog
into one release line:

- Download restoration contract alignment, including public
  `waitForRestoration()`, observable missing-task failures, foreign-task
  cancellation, and durable paused resume data.
- Download append-log compaction policy and an RFC for checksum, checkpoint,
  disk-full, and app-update recovery behavior.
- DocC smoke coverage for Download and WebSocket article examples.
- Benchmark trend automation with PR-comment rendering, JSONL trend storage,
  and baseline-rationale documentation.
- `URLQueryArrayEncodingStrategy` for indexed, bracketed, and repeated-key
  provider conventions.
- `WebSocketManager.shared` removal in favor of feature-scoped manager
  instances.
- Streaming-by-default inline transport through `bytes(for:)` and
  `ResponseBodyBufferingPolicy`.
- Public `RequestExecutionPolicy` extension points for custom transport-attempt
  policies.
- Shared `StateReducer` / `StateReduction` vocabulary plus reducer-driven
  Download, WebSocket, and refresh-token lifecycle decisions.
- `InnoNetworkPersistentCache` companion product with HMAC disk keys, App Group
  directory helper, statistics, and scrub/eviction telemetry.
- `MultipartStreamingResponseDecoder` for large multipart response streams.
- `InnoNetworkOpenAPI` companion product and VCR-style test support helpers.
- Compile-time macro diagnostics for optional path placeholders.
- Phantom generic auth markers on `EndpointBuilder` (shipped in 4.x, then
  replaced in 5.0 by explicit `SessionAuthentication` values).

## 4.x Typed-Throws Surface

`NetworkClient.request(_:)` / `request(_:tag:)` and
`UploadNetworkClient.upload(_:)` / `upload(_:tag:)` expose
`async throws(NetworkError)`. The typed-throws behavior shipped in 4.x; 5.0
separates request and upload requirements into independent capabilities.
Interceptors and execution policies
that produce arbitrary errors are normalized before they leave the client
surface so callers can switch on `NetworkError` directly.

The raw-string `request(_:method:tag:)` convenience from 4.x is removed in
5.0. Named requests use macro-assisted or manual `APIDefinition` structs;
runtime-composed requests use `EndpointBuilder` with explicit authentication.

The previous 5.0 candidate on this axis was not typed throws. The large
`NetworkConfiguration.init(...)` compatibility initializer was removed from
the public API before the 4.0.0 baseline, so 4.x examples and docs should use
`safeDefaults(baseURL:)`,
`advanced(baseURL:resilience:auth:observability:cache:transport:)`, or the
configuration-pack surface.

## 4.x Trust Pinning Module Split (shipped)

The pinning surface — `PublicKeyPinningPolicy`, the SPKI/DER helpers,
and the per-host evaluation logic — moved into a dedicated
`InnoNetworkTrust` companion product so apps that rely on Apple's ATS
defaults (probably 90% of consumers — pinning is operationally heavy
and a common cause of self-inflicted outages when a cert rotates) no
longer pay for the binary or review cost.

What shipped:

- `PublicKeyPinningPolicy`, `PublicKeyPinningPolicy.HostMatchingStrategy`,
  and the new `PublicKeyPinningEvaluator: TrustEvaluating` live in
  `Sources/InnoNetworkTrust/`. Adopters opt in with `import
  InnoNetworkTrust` and feed the evaluator into
  `TrustPolicy.custom(...)`.
- Core `InnoNetwork` keeps `TrustPolicy`, `TrustEvaluating`,
  `TrustFailureReason`, and the new `TrustChallengeOutcome` enum.
  `TrustEvaluating.evaluate(challenge:)` now returns the rich
  `TrustChallengeOutcome` so granular failure reasons (`.pinMismatch`,
  `.hostNotPinned`, `.publicKeyExtractionFailed`,
  `.systemTrustEvaluationFailed`) survive the split without telemetry
  regression.
- `TrustPolicy.publicKeyPinning(_:)` was removed outright. Adopters
  migrate by constructing `PublicKeyPinningEvaluator(policy:)` and
  passing it to `TrustPolicy.custom(_:)`. No re-export shim; the
  hard rename is announced in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `TrustPolicy` remains public and is supplied through ``TransportPack``. The
  value continues to flow through the same execution pipeline
  (`RequestExecutionPolicy`, `NetworkObservability`); only the declaration
  site of the pinning evaluator moves.

## 5.0 Body-Aware Reference Signers — AWS SigV4 and JWT Bearer

`HMACRequestInterceptor` remains in the core product. AWS-specific signing
ships in the optional `InnoNetworkAuthAWS` companion product so the first
request path does not imply AWS SDK coverage:

- **AWS SigV4** — `InnoNetworkAuthAWS.AWSSigV4Interceptor` is a
  canonical-request reference signer for AWS APIs and any service that adopts
  the same authorization scheme. It is not an AWS SDK replacement; streaming
  SigV4, presigned URLs, credential-provider chains, and service-specific
  behaviours stay out of scope.
- **JWT Bearer (request-minted)** — interceptor shape for backends that
  expect a JWT computed per request (claims include method/path).
  `RefreshTokenPolicy` already covers session-rotated bearer tokens, so
  this signer targets the request-minted lane only.

Reference signers conform to `RequestSigner` and observe the final
`RequestBody` after request interceptors and refresh-token application. Data
and stable file snapshots are supported; opaque body streams and SigV4
chunk-signing remain explicitly deferred to protocol-specific transports.

## Provisional to Stable Promotion Roadmap

| Surface | Current state | Promotion target | Done criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EndpointBuilder` runtime-composed path | Stable candidate before 4.0.0 | Stable at 4.0.0 | Runtime-composed request examples and migration cookbook shapes stay green. |
| `InnoNetworkAuthAWS` | Provisionally Stable | 5.x minor after field validation | AWS SigV4 vector tests, README/DocC reference-signer scope, and one adopter migration note. |
| `PersistentResponseCache` telemetry/statistics | Provisionally Stable | 5.x minor | Reentrancy invariant documented, persistent cache tests cover key rotation and stats. |
| `ResponseCachePolicy.rfc9111Compliant(wrapping:)` | Provisionally Stable | 5.x minor | Directive subset is documented as RFC 9111-aware, not full compliance, with cache policy tests. |
| Root `@APIDefinition` macro | Provisionally Stable in 5.x | Promoted to Stable in 6.0.0 | Explicit structs remain the source of truth; InnoSample and Mulbyul adoption plus diagnostics, body/query inference, macro smoke, and the core-only trait opt-out satisfy the promotion gate. |

## Post-5.0 RFC Parking Lot

These are deliberately not implemented in the 5.0.0 contract:

- `NetworkConfiguration.Transport`, `.Resilience`, `.Auth`, and
  `.Observability` nested naming can replace the current top-level pack names
  in a later major if adopter feedback shows the flatter names are confusing.
- `NetworkError` can move to a frozen outer wrapper plus an unfrozen inner
  `Reason` in a later major if catch sites need a smaller stable matching
  surface. Until then, the current enum stays the 5.x source shape.

## 5.0 Configuration Contract — Packs over AdvancedBuilder

`NetworkConfiguration` exposes a Packs-only public entry point:

```swift
NetworkConfiguration.advanced(
    baseURL: api,
    resilience: ResiliencePack(retry: ExponentialBackoffRetryPolicy()),
    auth: AuthPack(refreshToken: refresh),
    cache: CachePack(responseCachePolicy: .cacheFirst(maxAge: .seconds(60)))
)
```

Core's five pack value types (`ResiliencePack`, `AuthPack`,
`ObservabilityPack`, `CachePack`, `TransportPack`) carry its full
configuration surface. Download and WebSocket use the same model through
module-scoped transfer/retry/persistence and
connection/liveness/reconnect/messaging packs. Every underlying
`AdvancedBuilder` is `package`-only and unreachable from client code. Adopters
migrate by replacing closure mutations with equivalent named pack arguments.

## Explicitly Deferred

- Full WebSocket `permessage-deflate` (RFC 7692) negotiation remains out of
  the URLSession product. 4.0.0 now emits a terminal unsupported-feature
  diagnostic when the flag is enabled on URLSession; the natural path for real
  compression is a separate optional transport product with a non-zero
  dependency budget.
- Broader Download side-effect ownership remains out of this PR; Download
  already owns reducer-driven state decisions in 4.0.0.
- An NIO-backed WebSocket/HTTP transport product remains out of this PR so the
  core request product keeps its URLSession-first shape.
- Pulse/Sentry/OpenTelemetry adapter examples remain separate companion
  examples rather than core dependencies.
- Hummingbird or other server-side Swift in-process integration tests stay out
  of the Apple-client validation matrix.
- Full `StreamingRetryPolicy` beyond Last-Event-ID resume remains deferred.
  4.0.0 adds bounded output buffering but does not make arbitrary streams
  replayable.
- Multiple refresh-policy chains are deferred. 4.0.0 adds
  `RefreshTokenPolicy.appliesTo` for request-level routing while keeping one
  coordinator per client configuration.
- Header/query result-builder DSLs, mutation testing, full SwiftUI sample app,
  richer public HTTPTypes/OpenAPI conversion adapters, external generator
  version pinning, Linux-safe contracts, and iOS 17 LTS evaluation remain
  post-5.0 adoption work rather than GA blockers. The existing
  `InnoNetworkOpenAPI` transport owns a direct compatible 1.x
  `swift-http-types` dependency, currently validated with 1.6.0; the deferred
  item is broader public conversion API, not dependency hygiene at that
  companion boundary.

## Continuing Operations

- Keep benchmark baselines tied to a documented rationale in
  `Benchmarks/Baselines/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep `Scripts/check_docs_contract_sync.sh` as the release gate for public
  symbol drift, DocC smoke coverage, and docs/API promises.
- Keep `@unchecked Sendable` out of production sources; test-only exceptions
  should live in test or TestSupport targets.
- Revisit full WebSocket compression and alternate transports only after the
  URLSession-based products have a tagged 5.0.0 baseline.
- Continue hardening persistent cache operations with production feedback on
  eviction policy, data-protection defaults, app-group deployment, and privacy
  header policy.
