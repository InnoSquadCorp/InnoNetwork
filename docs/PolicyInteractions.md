# Policy Interactions

This page documents the policy order in the released 5.x contract. Use it when
combining retry, auth refresh, late request signing, response cache,
coalescing, circuit breaker, redirect handling, and custom execution policies.

## Interaction Matrix

| Scenario | 5.x behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Circuit open | Request fails before transport and is considered by the retry policy like any other `NetworkError`. |
| 401 with refresh policy | The current token is applied after request interceptors; one refresh replay uses the fully adapted request with the new token. |
| `RefreshTokenPolicy.appliesTo` returns false | No token is attached and 401 does not trigger refresh replay. |
| Duplicate request coalescing | Coalescing wraps raw transport attempts; auth-refresh replay and outer retry remain outside the shared result. |
| Cache hit | Fresh hits return before transport. Stale hits can revalidate and publish cache revalidation lifecycle events. |
| Authorization response cache write | Stored only when cache writes are enabled and the origin permits authenticated storage with `Cache-Control: public`, `must-revalidate`, or `s-maxage`. |
| 304 with changed `Vary` | The old body and vary snapshot are preserved; only freshness metadata is refreshed. |
| Unsafe cache invalidation | Successful unsafe methods invalidate cached variants for the target URI after refresh replay is decided and before response interceptors/status validation run. |
| Unsafe retry | POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE retry only when an idempotency key is present, unless the retry policy explicitly opts into method-agnostic behavior. `OPTIONS` and `TRACE` are safe-method defaults alongside GET/HEAD. |
| `IdempotencyKeyPolicy` enabled | The key is generated from the logical request id and reused across every retry attempt. |
| Redirect across origin | `DefaultRedirectPolicy` rejects HTTPS downgrades and any proposal retaining an unsafe method; other cross-origin hops strip every caller-prepared original header plus built-in and configured sensitive session headers. |
| Signed request | Signers observe the finalized data or stable file body after interceptors and current-token application. Signed requests bypass response cache, request coalescing, and URLSession caching, and reject every automatic redirect. |
| Custom execution policy | Runs after cache lookup/conditional-header preparation and before circuit breaker, coalescing, and URLSession. A policy observes or wraps one executor-owned request; returning a synthetic response bypasses circuit/coalescing/transport for that attempt. Request mutation belongs in a request interceptor. |
| Streaming request | Core `RetryPolicy`, cache, circuit breaker, coalescing, and custom execution policies are bypassed. The current token can be attached before the handshake, but 401 handshakes are not refresh-replayed; `StreamingResumePolicy.lastEventID` is the only built-in resume path. |

## Detailed Six-Policy Compatibility Matrix

The cells below describe what each policy does when the *row* policy fires
on a request that the *column* policy is also active for. Read horizontally:
"if Retry observes a failure under Cache, the result is …".

| ↓ Row fires \ Column active | **Cache** (`ResponseCachePolicy`) | **Retry** (`RetryPolicy`) | **Custom** (`RequestExecutionPolicy`) | **CircuitBreaker** | **Coalescing** | **Refresh** (`RefreshTokenPolicy`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cache** hit | returns cached body, no further policy fires | retry not consulted | custom policies not invoked | breaker not consulted | coalescer not consulted | refresh not consulted |
| **Cache** stale (revalidate) | dispatches revalidation through transport stack | revalidation failures count toward retry budget | custom policies wrap the revalidation attempt | recorded as a probe under host key | revalidation runs in its own coalescer slot | no token replay on revalidation |
| **Retry** schedules attempt N+1 | new attempt re-enters cache lookup | obeys `maxRetries` and `maxTotalRetries` | policy `retryIndex` increments with the new attempt | shares the host's open/half-open state | new dedup key per attempt; not reused | refresh replay does **not** consume a retry slot |
| **Custom** short-circuits | cache can still write the returned response | retry sees thrown policy errors like transport failures | this is the policy's own role | breaker is bypassed when `next.execute()` is skipped | coalescer is bypassed when `next.execute()` is skipped | refresh replay only sees returned 401 responses |
| **CircuitBreaker** open | request fails before transport with `.configuration(.invalidRequest(...))` | considered as a normal `NetworkError`; usually terminal | custom policy receives the breaker error from `next.execute()` | this is the breaker's own state | coalescer never reached | token already applied — request fails after adapt, before transport |
| **Coalescing** dedup hit | follower receives leader's response (and its cache write) | follower does not retry independently | followers share the leader result inside the same custom-policy call | follower inherits leader's circuit-breaker recording | this is the coalescer's own role | both leader and followers see the same auth header |
| **Refresh** triggered by 401 | unchanged: 401 cache writes are skipped | refresh replay does not consume a retry slot | replay runs through custom policies again with the refreshed request | replay still records breaker outcome | replay opens a fresh dedup key in a refresh-segregated lane | single-flight refresh; concurrent followers wait |

Two invariants the matrix encodes:

1. **Eligible unsigned cache hits short-circuit the transport stack.** A fresh
   hit means retry/breaker/coalescer/refresh do not run. Signed requests are
   never cache-eligible, so they continue through late signing and transport.
2. **Refresh replay is orthogonal to the retry budget.** A single
   `RefreshTokenPolicy` replay per request never decrements the
   `RetryPolicy.maxRetries` counter. Consumers that want to cap total
   "user-visible attempts" should plan for `maxRetries + 1` in worst-case
   401 paths.

## Deferred Beyond 5.0

Full streaming retry policy, multiple refresh-policy chains, and external
OpenTelemetry exporters are intentionally outside the planned 5.0 scope. They belong
in companion packages or a later 5.x release after the new signing and
request-identity contracts have production evidence.
