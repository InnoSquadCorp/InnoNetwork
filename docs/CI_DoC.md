# CI DoC (Definition of Completion)

This document defines the minimum completion criteria (DoC) for pull requests in InnoNetwork.

## Scope

- Applies to all PRs targeting `main`.
- Applies to direct pushes to `main`.
- Mirrors local validation commands used in development.

## Required CI Checks

The `CI` workflow must pass all of the following:

1. The root `Package.resolved` must remain tracked
   (`git ls-files --error-unmatch Package.resolved`), then
   `xcrun swift package resolve` must leave it unchanged. This is the
   reproducible CI lock and the input to the `Swift Dependency Submission`
   workflow. Main and pull requests use the same strict, lockfile-only
   converter; the richer release CycloneDX graph remains a separate release
   artifact. The main workflow submits every `main` SHA with job-scoped
   `contents: write`. A privileged `workflow_run` follow-up handles every PR,
   including Dependabot, by checking out only the trusted workflow revision
   and fetching the exact PR-head `Package.resolved` through the base
   repository Contents API as bounded JSON data. It never checks out or
   executes PR code, a PR artifact, `Package.swift`, or SwiftPM. The canonical
   macOS CI leg dry-runs the same converter without submitting it, so malformed
   locks and unsupported package sources fail before merge. Only HTTPS and
   GitHub's `git` SSH/SCP source forms are accepted; every source must resolve
   to one unambiguous GitHub owner/repository pair with both a semantic version
   and immutable revision. Branch-only and revision-only pins fail closed, as
   does changing a revision while retaining the same repository and version.
2. The pull-request-only `Dependency Review` job is blocking at `low` severity
   across runtime, development, and unknown scopes. It receives only
   `contents: read`. Before the pinned review action runs, CI polls the exact
   base/head comparison and requires GitHub's snapshot-warning header to be
   present and empty. A missing or incomplete graph therefore fails closed
   instead of producing an empty false-green review. The same read-only job
   checks out the exact trusted base verifier and revalidates the base/head
   lock transition, so an older persisted head snapshot cannot hide a
   same-version revision substitution after the PR base moves.
3. `xcrun swift build`
4. `xcrun swift test --no-parallel --enable-code-coverage`
5. A separate blocking `bash Scripts/run_bounded_parallel_tests.sh` job builds
   the suite once, then loads its test bundle in four concurrent, target-filtered
   Swift Testing processes without coverage instrumentation. Every process uses
   `--no-parallel`, so the Swift 6.2 testing runtime cannot exceed the intended
   four-process bound. Direct bundle loading avoids SwiftPM's shared `.build`
   lock; the script also proves that every discovered test belongs to exactly
   one shard.
6. `rg -n "@unchecked Sendable"` across production targets, including
   `Sources/InnoNetworkMacros`, returns no matches.
7. `bash Scripts/check_shared_coders_mutation.sh` confirms the shared default
   JSON coders are never mutated after construction.
8. `bash Scripts/check_production_force_unwraps.sh` returns no matches in
   production source targets. Tests and smoke fixtures are excluded.
9. `bash Scripts/check_no_print_in_production.sh` returns no matches in
   production source targets. Tests and smoke fixtures are excluded.
10. Runtime and macro coverage reports are generated from explicit, disjoint
   source roots under `.build/coverage/` and `.build/coverage-macros/`, then uploaded as
   separate workflow artifacts. Missing profiling data, test executables,
   source files, or LCOV records fail the job; artifact upload also uses
   `if-no-files-found: error`. Codecov receives only those explicit reports
   with `disable_search: true`, using separate `core` and `macros` flags.
   Dedicated upload jobs authenticate with short-lived GitHub OIDC credentials
   instead of a repository secret, so dependency builds and tests never receive
   `id-token: write`. They download a fixed Codecov CLI release and verify its
   SHA-256 before handing it to the pinned action, avoiding an unreviewed
   `latest` binary at upload time. Pull requests retain artifact-only fallback
   when CLI installation or an upload fails, while canonical `main` pushes
   require both uploads.
11. `apple-platform-build-smoke` runs `xcodebuild ... build` for macOS and iOS.
   For tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS it uses the installed device SDK plus the
   package's minimum target triple to cross-compile every public library
   product. This avoids depending on hosted-runner simulator runtimes that can
   be pruned independently of their SDKs. All five platforms are unconditional
   hard gates: a missing SDK, undiscoverable public product, or compile failure
   fails CI. `Scripts/check_apple_platform_build_contract.py` derives the five
   deployment floors from `Package.swift` and requires CI, release, local
   preflight, and the cross-build helper to retain the exact matching
   destinations and target triples. SwiftPM test+coverage remains the runtime
   test gate.
12. `python3 Scripts/check_example_platform_floors.py` discovers every
    independent `Examples/*/Package.swift`, requires the root package's exact
    deployment floors, and requires CI and release to invoke the same automatic
    example builder. `Scripts/build_consumer_examples.sh` discovers the same
    manifests at execution time, so a new correctly versioned example cannot
    silently miss CI, release, or local preflight.
13. Consumer smoke verifies `Macros` is a default trait, the default package
   graph includes `swift-syntax`, and the `InnoNetworkMacros` target
   dependency is conditioned on that trait. It then performs a clean
   `--disable-default-traits` root build and rejects compiled macro products
   before building separate core-only (`traits: []`), aggregate, wrapper,
   download-only, websocket-only, test-support, generated-client, event-policy
   observer, and macro usage packages, including
   `Examples/WrapperSmoke` and `Examples/EventPolicyObserver`. The independent
   `Examples/MacroAdopterSmoke` executable then runs macro-generated GET and
   POST endpoints through the public `DefaultNetworkClient` and
   `InnoNetworkTestSupport` boundary so path/query/body/auth generation is a
   runtime release gate rather than compile-only evidence.
   SwiftPM 6.2 can still resolve, fetch, or list manifest-level dependencies
   during a core-only build; the invariant is that macro products are absent
   from compilation. Traits are unified per package, so another dependency
   enabling default traits re-enables `Macros`.
14. `bash Scripts/check_provisional_enum_cases.sh` confirms guarded public enum
    cases still match their migration-review allowlist.
15. Macro tests run from source with
    `--disable-experimental-prebuilts --filter InnoNetworkMacroTests`, and
    `Scripts/check_macro_compile_failures.sh` verifies that invalid definitions
    fail with the intended diagnostic rather than compiling silently. The
    fixtures also require an unannotated request value to receive the targeted
    `@APIDefinition` correction at the `NetworkClient.request` boundary.
16. The CI benchmark smoke job runs
    `swift run -c release InnoNetworkBenchmarks --quick`
    and uploads the JSON summary to prove the benchmark CLI still builds and
    emits parseable results. Regression enforcement lives in the dedicated
    `Benchmarks` workflow: pull requests use the guarded benchmark set with
    `--enforce-baseline --max-regression-percent 20`, while scheduled/manual
    runs use the same guarded benchmarks with a stricter 10% threshold. Use
    `--guard-threshold group/name=percent` for benchmark-specific exceptions
    and `--regression-reason` when a PR intentionally updates or accepts a
    baseline movement; both values appear in the JSON artifact and PR comment.
17. `python3 Scripts/check_macro_build_baseline_contract.py` validates the
    committed five-repeat SwiftPM and Xcode macro-consumer baselines. It fails
    on missing Core-only or 0/10/50/200-endpoint phases, short sample sets,
    invalid medians, or missing provenance. Absolute local timings are not CI
    thresholds; future comparisons use same-runner medians.
18. `python3 Scripts/check_release_workflow_contract.py` requires a manual
    `workflow_dispatch` validation path, tag-only release-ref validation, and a
    job-level tag-only guard on publication. Manual runs validate the selected
    commit against freshly fetched `origin/main` with
    `Scripts/validate_release_candidate.sh`; they can upload candidate evidence
    but cannot sign artifacts or create a GitHub Release.

The release workflow repeats the root lock, platform-floor, all-example,
platform-build, and full-test gates. It also builds and tests
`Tools/openapi-to-innonetwork`, matching the CI consumer-smoke contract before
release artifacts are generated.

## Pass/Fail Policy

- A PR is considered complete only when all CI checks are green.
- If any check fails, the PR is not merge-ready.
- Concurrency regressions and `@unchecked Sendable` additions in production sources are blocking failures.
- Force unwrap additions in production sources are blocking failures; fixture
  force unwraps belong in tests or smoke-only targets.
- Adding `print()` to production sources is a blocking failure. The rule is
  enforced by `bash Scripts/check_no_print_in_production.sh`, matching required
  check 9 above.

## Integration Tests Policy

- Network-dependent tests should remain opt-in via `INNO_LIVE=1`.
- Default CI runs deterministic unit tests only.
- `Nightly Live Smoke` runs core live tests, WebSocket, persistent cache,
  Download pause/resume, and OpenAPI as independent jobs so one slow endpoint
  cannot prevent the other surfaces from reporting. WebSocket and OpenAPI stay
  best-effort because their public fixtures are third-party services; the fixed
  Download fixture is a blocking regression signal for completion staging.

## Local Reproduction

Run the same commands locally:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_26.0.1.app
# Preferred local entry point. The default fast mode runs the deterministic
# contracts, all independent consumer packages, the OpenAPI generator suite,
# and the same bounded root test shards used by CI.
bash Scripts/run_local_release_preflight.sh

# Before approving a release-state commit, replay every locally reproducible
# release gate: coverage, 10% guarded benchmarks, both SBOM profiles,
# all-product DocC, and macOS/iOS/tvOS/watchOS/visionOS builds. Generated
# evidence remains under .build/local-release-preflight/ for inspection.
bash Scripts/run_local_release_preflight.sh --full

# The commands below document the individual gates for diagnosis.
