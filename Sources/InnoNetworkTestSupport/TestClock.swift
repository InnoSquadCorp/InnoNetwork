/// production paths use `SystemClock`, and tests inject this implementation
/// to drive timing deterministically via `advance(by:)` instead of
/// wall-clock sleeps.
///
/// Implementation notes:
/// - State is held behind an `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` so that enqueue,
///   cancellation, and `advance` all serialise synchronously. This avoids the
///   race where `withTaskCancellationHandler.onCancel` schedules async cleanup
///   that has not yet landed when the test calls `advance` — that race would
///   let a cancelled waiter wake up with success and let the `try await
///   clock.sleep(for:)` call return normally after its enclosing task was
///   cancelled.
/// - `sleep(for:)` also performs `Task.checkCancellation()` after resuming so
///   a waiter that was fired in a tight race with cancellation still surfaces
///   as `CancellationError` to the caller.
