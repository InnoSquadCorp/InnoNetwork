# Observability exporters

Bridge ``NetworkEventObserving`` events into vendor SDKs (Sentry,
OpenTelemetry, Pulse, Datadog) through external adapter packages
without coupling the core library to any specific telemetry vendor.

## Why adapters live outside this package

InnoNetwork's observability surface is intentionally vendor-neutral.
``NetworkEvent`` exposes structured request lifecycle events, and
``NetworkConfiguration/eventObservers`` attaches observers to the
client. A vendor SDK adapter is glue code: it forwards those events to
the vendor's tracer/span/breadcrumb API in the format the vendor
expects.

Putting that glue inside InnoNetwork would either pull every supported
vendor into the package graph (build-time cost, transitive license
exposure) or fragment the API behind compile-time flags. The vendor
adapter pattern keeps the core surface small and lets each adapter
ship at the cadence of its underlying vendor SDK.

## Adapter shape

A typical adapter is a small product that depends on InnoNetwork plus
the vendor SDK and exposes one or more observer types:

```swift
import InnoNetwork
import Sentry

public struct SentryNetworkEventObserver: NetworkEventObserving {
    public init() {}

    public func handle(_ event: NetworkEvent) async {
        switch event {
        case .requestStart(let requestID, let method, let url, let retryIndex):
            SentrySDK.startTransaction(
                name: "\(method) \(url)",
                operation: "http.client"
            )
            _ = (requestID, retryIndex)
        case .requestFinished(let requestID, let statusCode, let byteCount):
            SentrySDK.addBreadcrumb(Breadcrumb(level: .info, category: "http.client"))
            _ = (requestID, statusCode, byteCount)
        case .requestFailed(let requestID, let errorCode, let message):
            SentrySDK.capture(message: "request_failed \(errorCode): \(message)")
            _ = requestID
        default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```

The caller plugs the observer into ``NetworkConfiguration``:

```swift
let configuration = NetworkConfiguration.advanced(baseURL: apiBaseURL) { builder in
    builder.eventObservers.append(SentryNetworkEventObserver())
}
```

The adapter owns:

- Event-to-vendor type mapping (transactions, spans, breadcrumbs).
- Sampling rules - InnoNetwork emits every event; the adapter decides
  what to forward.
- Vendor-specific lifecycle (transaction commit, breadcrumb buffer
  flush) tied to request boundaries.

Use ``NetworkMetricsReporting`` alongside observers when a vendor needs
raw `URLSessionTaskMetrics`; event observers are for logical lifecycle
events, while metrics reporters receive Foundation's transport metrics.

## Example sketches

### OpenTelemetry

Map each `.requestStart` event to a span, decorate it with
`http.request.method` and `url.full`, then attach
`http.response.status_code` and `network.response.body.size` from the
matching `.requestFinished` or `.responseReceived` event. Retry
attempts can be represented as child spans by keying in-flight spans by
`requestID`.

### Pulse

Pulse already speaks a structured logging API. The adapter forwards
`.requestStart`, `.responseReceived`, `.requestFinished`, and
`.requestFailed` to a Pulse network logger and lets the Pulse UI render
the rest. Body capture should be gated by a sampling closure on the
adapter - InnoNetwork does not buffer bodies for observability by
default.

### Datadog

Datadog RUM and APM both have HTTP request models. An adapter
typically forwards to RUM's resource API for foreground traffic and
to the tracer for backend-style flows. Retry decisions from
`.retryScheduled` and refresh-token failures from `.requestFailed` map
cleanly to RUM's error and action surfaces.

### Sentry

Wrap each request in a transaction keyed by the observed method and URL
or by an endpoint label supplied by the adapter's caller. Surface
``NetworkError`` cases as captured errors with the canonical category
as a tag so Sentry's grouping respects InnoNetwork's classification.
Refresh-token cycles should be breadcrumbs rather than transactions -
they're frequent and not interesting on their own unless they fail.

## Versioning and compatibility

Adapter packages should pin their InnoNetwork dependency to a minor
range (`from: "4.0.0"`) and bump on every observability surface change.
The 4.x line aims to keep changes additive; adapters should include a
`default:` case in event switches so new ``NetworkEvent`` cases do not
break compilation before the adapter has mapped them.
