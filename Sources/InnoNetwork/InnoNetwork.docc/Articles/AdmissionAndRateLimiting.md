# Admission and rate limiting

Bound physical transport work without changing cache or coalescing semantics.

Configure both policies through ``ResiliencePack``:

```swift
let configuration = NetworkConfiguration.advanced(
    baseURL: apiBaseURL,
    resilience: ResiliencePack(
        admission: RequestAdmissionPolicy(
            maximumConcurrentRequests: 8,
            maximumPendingRequests: 32,
            maximumQueueWait: .seconds(5),
            maximumConcurrentStreams: 2,
            maximumPendingStreams: 4
        ),
        advancedRateLimit: AdvancedRateLimitPolicy(
            algorithm: .tokenBucket(capacity: 20, refillPerSecond: 5)
        )
    )
)
```

Admission runs at the physical transport boundary, so cache hits and coalesced
followers do not consume request permits. Long-lived stream bodies use separate
slots and cannot exhaust the ordinary request pool. Every queue and origin
registry is bounded; cancellation and pre-dispatch failures release capacity.
An origin blocked by its own cap does not prevent another origin from using
available global capacity. Fully replenished, inactive quota scopes are
reclaimed when the registry needs room for a new origin. A committed transport
keeps its scope active until response headers or a terminal transport error are
observed, so late server feedback cannot be discarded during origin churn.

Choose a token bucket for bursts with a steady refill, or an exact sliding
window when the server contract is expressed as requests per interval. The
optional IETF draft-11 response adapter is explicitly versioned because the
RateLimit field is still a draft contract. `Retry-After` remains independently
supported. Server hints only reduce local availability within configured bounds;
they never increase the caller's local quota.

Policy numbers are validated when physical work first needs the limiter.
Non-finite or nonpositive capacities, refill rates, costs, and windows fail as
configuration errors; a cost larger than the configured bucket or window is
also rejected. A reservation made before concurrency admission is rechecked
after a slot is obtained. If quota is no longer available, the slot is released
before the task waits and competes for admission again, so queued work cannot
hold transport capacity while it is rate-delayed.

``NetworkEvent/decision(_:)`` exposes allowed, delayed, and denied policy
outcomes without request payloads.
