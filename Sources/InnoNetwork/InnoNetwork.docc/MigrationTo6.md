# Migrating to InnoNetwork 6

Adopt the operation, failure, and configuration contracts promoted into the
core module in InnoNetwork 6.

## Overview

Import `InnoNetwork`, keep existing endpoint definitions, and wrap an existing
client or create one from the configuration façade:

```swift
import Foundation
import InnoNetwork

let configuration = NetworkClientConfiguration.production(
    baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.example.com")!,
    resilience: ResiliencePack(
        customExecutionPolicies: [
            RateLimitExecutionPolicy(maximumRequests: 10, per: .seconds(1))
        ]
    )
)
let client = OperationNetworkClient<DefaultNetworkClient>(
    configuration: configuration
)
let operation = client.start(GetProfile())

do {
    let profile = try await operation.value()
    _ = profile
} catch {
    switch error.recovery {
    case .retry: scheduleRetry()
    case .waitForConnectivity: showOfflineState()
    case .reauthenticate: presentSignIn()
    case .doNotRetry, .none: showFailure()
    @unknown default: showFailure()
    }
}
```

``NetworkFailure`` is a value-only boundary: it does not retain response
bodies, headers, URLs, or arbitrary underlying error descriptions. Use
``NetworkOperation/events`` for a bounded operation-local start/terminal
lifecycle, and retain the existing `NetworkEventObserving` integration for
attempt-level production telemetry.

Recovery is contextual. `OperationNetworkClient` recommends `.retry` for
GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE by default. Unsafe methods such as POST remain
`.doNotRetry` even for transient status codes and timeouts because the server
may already have applied their side effect. Opt in only when the application
owns a stable idempotency key and reuses it across operation restarts:

```swift
let operation = client.start(
    CreateOrder(idempotencyKey: orderAttemptID),
    replaySafety: .stableIdempotencyKey
)
```

Starting in the additive 6.1 candidate, a buffered operation can also own one
end-to-end monotonic deadline:

```swift
let operation = client.start(
    GetProfile(),
    deadline: NetworkOperationDeadline(after: .seconds(2))
)

do {
    let profile = try await operation.value()
    _ = profile
} catch {
    if let stage = error.deadlineStage {
        recordDeadlineExhaustion(stage)
    }
}
```

This budget includes policy admission, authentication, retry delay, transport,
and response decoding. It is distinct from URLSession request and resource
timeouts. The deadline is one absolute monotonic instant captured before the
operation task is dispatched: a zero duration does not start the wrapped
request, and a late result cannot turn an expired operation into success.
`deadlineStage` reflects the active execution boundary, including policy
admission before physical transport. Deadline expiry cancels built-in client
work; a custom ``NetworkClient`` used through ``OperationNetworkClient`` must
cooperate with Swift task cancellation. The operation-first surface is
buffered, so this API does not claim to bound the lifetime of a separately
returned streaming sequence.

The automatic `IdempotencyKeyPolicy` uses the logical request identifier. A
new `NetworkOperation` receives a new identifier, so that policy alone does
not prove that an application-level restart is safe. A 401 maps to
`.reauthenticate` only for `.optional` or `.required` session-authenticated
endpoints; 403 is an authorization failure and stays terminal. Reauthentication
does not authorize automatic replay of the failed operation.

The 5.x `InnoNetworkNext` product no longer exists. Remove that product from
the package dependency and replace `import InnoNetworkNext` with
`import InnoNetwork`. The source names of its preview types are unchanged.

## Stable macro-first endpoint contract

``APIDefinition(method:path:auth:)`` is Stable in 6.0. Existing annotated
endpoint declarations require no source migration. The default-enabled
`Macros` trait and explicit `traits: []` opt-out are Stable as well, while
manual ``APIDefinition`` conformance remains the supported non-macro fallback.
Existing accepted declarations retain their generated method, percent-encoded
path, authentication, conformance, and payload-witness meaning throughout 6.x.

## Move HLS product ownership to InnoStream

The HLS product and module names remain unchanged, but their SwiftPM package
owner changes. After InnoNetwork `6.0.0` and InnoStream `1.0.0` are published,
change a target dependency from:

```swift
.product(name: "InnoNetworkHLS", package: "InnoNetwork")
```

to:

```swift
.product(name: "InnoNetworkHLS", package: "InnoStream")
```

and add the InnoStream package dependency:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/InnoSquadCorp/InnoStream.git",
    .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")
)
```

Apply the same owner change to `InnoNetworkHLSLive`,
`InnoNetworkHLSAVFoundation`, and `InnoNetworkHLSAudio`. Existing
`import InnoNetworkHLS...` statements do not change. A local sibling checkout
is useful before release, but only a clean build resolving both published tags
proves the final dependency graph.
