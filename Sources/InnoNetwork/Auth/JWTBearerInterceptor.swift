/// `RequestInterceptor` that attaches a JWT bearer token to outgoing
/// requests through the standard `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
///
/// Use this interceptor for the **request-minted** lane only — backends
/// where the JWT claims include the request method/path or otherwise
/// have to be re-signed per call. Session-rotated bearer tokens (the
/// common OAuth2 pattern) are better served by ``RefreshTokenPolicy``,
/// which already coalesces single-flight refresh and replays one
/// in-flight request after a 401.
///
/// The interceptor itself is intentionally minimal: it pulls a token
/// string from a caller-supplied async closure and writes the
/// `Authorization` header. Key material — HS256 secrets, RS256/ES256
/// private keys — never lives inside the interceptor; the closure can
/// hold a reference to a Keychain item, a Secure Enclave handle, or a
/// remote token-mint service. That keeps the interceptor `Sendable`
/// without leaking key material into log dumps or error chains.
///
/// Typical wiring against a Keychain-backed actor:
///
/// ```swift
/// let auth = AuthService(...)
/// let signer = JWTBearerInterceptor { request in
///     try await auth.mintJWT(for: request)
/// }
/// // Attach to the configuration's request interceptors:
/// let config = NetworkConfiguration.advanced(baseURL: baseURL) {
///     $0.requestInterceptors.append(signer)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The interceptor does **not** mint, encode, or sign the JWT. That work
/// is delegated to the caller because the algorithm matrix
/// (HS256/RS256/ES256/EdDSA) and the claims set are application-specific
/// and outside the scope of a generic networking library.
public struct JWTBearerInterceptor: RequestInterceptor {
