# ``InnoNetworkWebSocket``

Connection-oriented realtime flows with reconnect-aware lifecycle handling, heartbeat monitoring, and explicit WebSocket event delivery.

## Overview

`InnoNetworkWebSocket` wraps `URLSessionWebSocketTask` with a state model that is easier to reason about in production clients.

Use this module when you need:

- reconnect-aware connection management
- heartbeat and pong timeout handling, surfaced as paired `.ping` / `.pong` /
  `.error(.pingTimeout)` events
- typed close-code handling via ``WebSocketCloseCode``
- async handshake request adaptation via ``WebSocketHandshakeRequestAdapter``
- listener retention across automatic reconnect transport generations
- explicit retry through ``WebSocketManager/retry(_:)``, which returns a fresh
  task and a pre-registered bounded event stream in ``WebSocketRetryResult``
- manual disconnect semantics that stay visible to the caller

Reconnect decisions are driven by handshake and close outcomes, so the public manager can distinguish retryable failures from terminal ones without forcing application code to rebuild that policy every time.

Create feature-scoped ``WebSocketManager`` instances so reconnect, heartbeat,
send-buffer, and event-delivery policy stay owned by the feature that opens the
socket. See <doc:FeatureScopedManagers>.

Event delivery for socket tasks flows through the shared event hub. Tune
buffering, overflow behavior, and metrics integration through
``WebSocketObservabilityPack`` — see the [event delivery guide](https://innosquadcorp.github.io/InnoNetwork/InnoNetwork/documentation/innonetwork/eventdeliveryguide)
in the core module.

### Observing heartbeat attempts

The unreleased 5.0 preview emits a `.ping` event before each heartbeat or
manual ping attempt, as planned for the future 5.x contract. Pair it with
`.pong` and `.error(.pingTimeout)` to track heartbeat success, timeout, and
approximate round-trip timing in application code.

For pong, event publication is attempted before the snapshotted manager
handler is invoked. The event still uses ordinary bounded overflow and listener
delivery is asynchronous, so the event can be dropped and no listener-versus-
handler execution order is guaranteed.

```swift
var pendingPingAt: Date?

for await event in await manager.events(for: task) {
    switch event {
    case .ping(_):
        pendingPingAt = .now
    case .pong(_):
        if let started = pendingPingAt {
            metrics.recordPingRTT(.now.timeIntervalSince(started))
        }
        pendingPingAt = nil
    case .error(.pingTimeout):
        metrics.recordPingTimeout()
        pendingPingAt = nil
    default:
        break
    }
}
```
