# Forbids `print(` calls in shipping library targets.
#
# print() in production code is almost always a leftover debug
# statement that escapes review and ships to App Store builds where
# it pollutes Console.app and exfiltrates state. Operational logging
# should go through `NetworkLogger` / `OSLogNetworkEventObserver`
# instead.
#
# Excluded from the check:
#   - Tests / SmokeTests / Examples / Benchmarks: print() is allowed
#     for human-readable diagnostics in CLI smoke targets.
#   - DocC tutorial resources (Sources/**/.docc/Resources/*.swift):
#     these are example snippets surfaced to the reader, not shipped
#     code paths.
#   - InnoNetworkTestSupport: shipped to consumer test targets only;
#     not part of any production binary.
