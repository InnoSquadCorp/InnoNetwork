# Enforces the package's `@unchecked Sendable` policy.
#
# Two zones with different rules:
#
#   1. Production library targets (Sources/InnoNetwork{,AuthAWS,Download,
#      PersistentCache,WebSocket,Trust,OpenAPI}) — `@unchecked Sendable` is
#      forbidden. Strict-concurrency static analysis must succeed by
#      construction; if a real escape hatch is needed, design a proper
#      actor or use the per-call locking primitives already in the
#      library, do not push the burden onto reviewers.
#
#   2. InnoNetworkTestSupport — `@unchecked Sendable` is allowed because
#      the target ships `package`-scoped helpers consumed only by the
#      package's own test targets (TestClock, FaultInjection, ...). The
#      gate still enforces *some* due diligence: any file declaring an
#      `@unchecked Sendable` type must also contain at least one doc
#      comment (`///`) so a reviewer can find the safety justification
#      without spelunking through git blame. This catches drive-by
#      additions where someone reaches for `@unchecked` without
#      explaining *why* the manual concurrency contract is sound.
#
# Replaces the previous inline check that lived in `.github/workflows/
# ci.yml` so the rule is reusable from `pre-commit` hooks and so future
# zones (Examples/, Tools/) can be added by editing this file rather
# than the workflow YAML.
